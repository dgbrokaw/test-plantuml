This is to test PlantUML integration with VSC.

I am using this extension: `jebbs.plantuml`.

I followed the Windows install instructions in that extension's docs.

Adding the Java install to my Path environment variable didn't work. I added the executable path to the settings with `plantuml.java`.

Attempting to show the UML in the README...

GitHub included a token at the end of the URL, which I discarded. The UML did not display. Clicking the "image" shows this: `Non-Image content-type returned`.

It won't work with a private repository!
